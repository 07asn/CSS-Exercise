# Homework: HTML & CSS Layouts

This project focuses on creating various HTML and CSS layouts based on given image designs. The goal was to replicate these designs. The layouts include text, and containers, each styled to match the images.

### Definitions:

- **Nesting**: In HTML, nesting refers to placing elements within other elements to create a hierarchy or structure. This is common in lists, tables, and div-based layouts. For example, a list can be nested within another list, or a div can be nested inside another div.

- **Lists Styling**: CSS allows you to style ordered and unordered lists using properties like `list-style-type`, `list-style-position`, and `list-style-image`. You can modify the appearance of list items, such as changing the bullet point style or adding custom icons or numbers.

- **Table Styling**: CSS properties like `border`, `padding`, `text-align`, `background-color`, and `width` help enhance the table's appearance. You can also apply styles to table elements such as `<th>`, `<tr>`, `<td>`, and `<caption>`.
