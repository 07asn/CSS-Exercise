# Homework: HTML & CSS Layouts

This project focuses on creating various HTML and CSS layouts based on given image designs. The goal was to replicate these designs by writing responsive, structured code while applying appropriate styling and layout techniques. The layouts include text, images, and containers, each styled to match the visual specifications.

### Definitions:

- **Nesting**: In HTML, nesting refers to placing elements within other elements to create a hierarchy or structure. This is common in lists, tables, and div-based layouts. For example, a list can be nested within another list, or a div can be nested inside another div.

- **Lists Styling**: CSS allows you to style ordered and unordered lists using properties like `list-style-type`, `list-style-position`, and `list-style-image`. You can modify the appearance of list items, such as changing the bullet point style or adding custom icons or numbers.

- **Table Styling**: Tables can be styled using CSS to improve their presentation and readability. CSS properties like `border`, `padding`, `text-align`, `background-color`, and `width` help enhance the table's appearance. You can also apply styles to table elements such as `<th>`, `<tr>`, `<td>`, and `<caption>` to customize the look and layout of the table.
